maps:
    planets
    space stations
    moons

    split maps into smaller quadrants
    640 x 640 works well for quadrants (smaller size decreases mem usage and cpu usage)

campaign:
    defense points / factory building
    attack points / offense, no building


Materials:
    
    Tier 1

    Iron plate      <- Iron ore
    Lead plate      <- Lead ore
    Copper plate    <- Copper ore
    Silicon         <- Quartz

    Tier 2

    PCB             <- Silicon, Copper plate, Lead plate
    Motor           <- Copper plate, Iron plate
    Steel           <- Iron plate
    Copper wire     <- Copper plate

    Tier 3

    Processor       <- Copper wire, Silicon, PCB
    Solar panel     <- Copper Wire, Silicon, Steel, PCB
